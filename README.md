# Lending Club Case Study
   
   Business Understanding : This is consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. 
        When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile
    
    The data given contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. 
    The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, 
    reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
